<h1>Scraping EDR</h1>
<p>This epigraphic database returns a php page with LOTS of great inscriptions, but these (tens of) thousands of inscriptions are not necessarily easy to organize / read, and certainly are not set up for machine reading.</p>

<p>So this project will attempt to organize the page into python dictionaries where the text is just one of a few different fields.</p>

<p>We'll then attempt to clean the data, removing criticial sigla that are valuable to the scholar but make for less legible texts.</p>

<p>My motivation for doing this is to obtain a sizable body of authentic teaching material for novice-intermediate Latin students</p>
